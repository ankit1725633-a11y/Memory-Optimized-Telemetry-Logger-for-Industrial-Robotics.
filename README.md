🧠 Memory-Optimized Telemetry Logger (Robot Black Box)
📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Deterministic Telemetry Logger for an Industrial Robot / AMR (Autonomous Mobile Robot).
It functions as a robotic “black box”, recording and retaining critical runtime data such as Speed, Temperature, and System Status.

The design emphasizes memory efficiency, deterministic behavior, and safe data recovery, making it suitable for embedded and safety-critical systems.
